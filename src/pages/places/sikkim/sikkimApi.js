However, since this lake is one of the world’s highest lakes, you might face high altitude breathing problems, so make sure you don’t stay here for long. Then, head back to your hotel, have lunch, and set off to explore Lachen Monastery. You can then opt to check out from your hotel, and start your drive toward Lachung, which will be around 3 hours' drive. Needless to say, Lachung is another beautiful hamlet in North Sikkim, and is dotted with numerous sightseeing options. Stay here at night, and spend your evening as you feel like.",
